# Pokedex_App
Application built over several days showcasing the list of available Pokemons and their details. Able to click into specific Pokemon to display their individual cards. App consumes the PokeAPI. App built as part of a technical challenge to showcase knowledge of API calls and working with React components (passed challenge requests to progress to next stage).

## Code detail

Code frameworks used:
React.js

Reacr-Router

Attempted to use modular layout with nested components instead of a single massive file. Used axios to extract necessary data from the API and display them to the user.

## Roadmap
In the upcoming days I would like to focus on polishing up the visual presentation, adding a significant amount of detail to the individual Pokemon cards. Main focus will be on resolving CORS issues specific API calls
